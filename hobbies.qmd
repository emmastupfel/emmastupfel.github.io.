## Hobbies:

-   Basket weaving: Had a very rigorous education in basket weaving. The hobby is meditative and a fun activity. Baskets are sold for a profit

-   Skiing: I've been skiing since I was 5, and I love it because it feels like I'm always improving or working on something.

-   Origami: Like basket weaving it is meditative and often I make tiny paper baskets and put them in the baskets that have been woven.
